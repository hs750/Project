/**
 * LearningAlgorithm is an interface which describes how an agent should be able
 * to interact with learning algorithms in general. This allows for each agent
 * to learn individually or collectively (in the case of a centralised learner).
 * Learning algorithms should be able to:
 * 
 *  - Select an action based solely on the state provided
 *  - Update itself based upon the state it was in, the state it moved into,
 *    the action taken, and the received reward for said state transition
 *  - Be informed of the number of actions currently available to select from
 * 
 * The library provides a fair few different learning algorithms built in and
 * ready to use and has separated them out in such a way that customisations
 * should be easy.
 * For example: If your agent must decide upon which action to take and one
 * needs a magnitude you could create an extra method in your learning algorithm
 * to account for this extra information to be called after said action has
 * been selected.
