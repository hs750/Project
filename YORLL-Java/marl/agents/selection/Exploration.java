/**
 * The Exploration interface defines a means for agents to choose between
 * different possible actions based upon some numerical valuation.
 * 
 * Agents inform the Environment which action they are to take by giving it the
 * reference integer assigned to said action. The integers are assigned from
 * 0 - n, where n is the number of available actions. Because of this an array
 * of doubles with the action/value pairs can be provided and then an
 * implementing algorithm will return the index of the action chosen.
