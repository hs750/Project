/**
 * An Agent is an abstract class that must be extended on a per-experiment
 * basis. An agent should contain all the logic for the agent to learn and
 * select actions. There are pre-built learning algorithms which may be used
 * directly or modified through extension, likewise for action selection
 * algorithms.
 * 
 * If the learning algorithms that are contained within the library are not
 * what is required then it is recommended that you implement your own using
 * the {@link LearningAlgorithm} interface. The same should be said for the
 * the {@link Exploration} interface for action selection.
 * NB. Exceptions can be made, see {@link Argmax} for example.
