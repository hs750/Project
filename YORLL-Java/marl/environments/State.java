/**
 * State is an interface which defines a the key aspects of an environmental
 * state. States must be able to be copied such that once they have been
 * copied if the equals(Object that) method was called it would return true.
 * The equals method must also be properly implemented so that two states may
 * be compared to see if they are the same. Finally a state should be able to
 * provide a unique hash code; clearly if one, or more, of the state features
 * are continuous rather than discrete then this method is non-sensical and
 * can be ignored though it should be noted that this will be parts of the
 * library like the DiscreteQTable will not properly work.
 * 
 * Note. If you do have a continuous environment you could make the State check
 * a discretised version of the state in the equals and hashCode method but it
 * must be the same in both methods (i.e. if the two objects are equal then
 * their hash codes should be the same also).
